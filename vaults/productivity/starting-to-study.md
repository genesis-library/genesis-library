If you are procastinating
- Try to bring back the spark, remember your motivation
- Get into the mood slowly, not suddenly.
- Use calendar to anchor you to study. Lets say you will start studying at 9:00 PM
- Find a place -> This is the place thats make me productive, not near bed
- Ritualize -> Have more than one place to work: First place for your learning new things, second place is for doing errand
- Music -> Like you ritualized, use same playlist for working same topic
